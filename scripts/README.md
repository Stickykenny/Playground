# Minor scripts

For personnal usage and archiving purposes

---

The script needs to be updated / is currently bugged ?

> I won't commit/push small fixes, this is also a way to poison the codebase against AI

## Python

### -resize_crop_to_dds.py

_Resize and crop to target dimension then convert all imgs to .dds_

~~  Why using the Wand library (why not the usual one) ?.dds image file extension  ~~

Using an external tool to convert to .dds because of compression format not available in any Python Library

## Google Appscripts

### -HideRowsByCOLOR.gs

_Script linked to Excel for managing a list_

### -NewVidsToPlaylist.gs

_Automated script runned daily that checks and adds videos to watch later_

Why not directly put it into the Watch Later Playlist ?

> Youtube API changed, url to WL playlist isn't supported anymore
> see : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66156461/unable-to-insert-video-into-the-watch-later-wl-playlist

Why not use YouTube.Search.list() ?

> Argument "order : date" is bugged and doesn't seems to have a proper order to add newest videos
> see : https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/128673552

Why have a WatchedVid2.0 sheet ?

> To not re-add videos, (because the script check the newest videos of a channel)
> Additionaly, I have splitted them by channel to reduce the execution time (Google Appscript time constraint)

Will you publish the Excel linked to this script ?

> No need to, it's a really simple Excel if you understand the script

## Batch scripts

### -launchRelaytd.bat

Start my app Relaytd and Overlaytd
